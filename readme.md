### Exercise projest files

This is the code repository for [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning [Second Edition]]. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

### The Starter Files

There is a folder called "javascript-sandbox-start", which contains the starter files for the learning modules and any themes (HTML/CSS) for the projects. You can use these to follow along with the course or create your own files as you go.

- index.html in root folder using links for browser editor and dev tools
- VS Code settings extensions {better comments, TODO comments, fonts etc.}
